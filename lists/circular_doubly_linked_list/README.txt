* DESCRIPTION: Implementation of a circular doubly linked list using a dummy node at the beginning of the list and a pointer 'firstList' pointing to the dummy node. The dummy node lets us generalize the insert/delete operations without treating insertion/deletion at the extremities of the list as special cases.
